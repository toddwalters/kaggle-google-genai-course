In contrast, this notebook, along with the others in this series, will use the [Gemini Developer API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/) and [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Both APIs provide access to the Gemini family of models, and the code to interact with the models is very similar. Vertex provides a world-class platform for enterprises, governments and advanced users that need powerful features like data governance, ML ops and deep Google Cloud integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "AI Studio is free to use and only requires a compatible Google account to log in and get started. It is deeply integrated with the Gemini API, which comes with a generous [free tier](https://ai.google.dev/pricing) that you can use to run the code in these exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are already set up with Google Cloud, you can check out the [Enterprise Gemini API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/inference) through Vertex AI, and run the samples directly from the supplied whitepapers."

    "To stop the model from generating tokens past a limit, you can specify the `max_output_tokens` parameter when using the Gemini API. Specifying this parameter does not influence the generation of the output tokens, so the output will not become more stylistically or textually succinct, but it will stop generating tokens once the specified length is reached. Prompt engineering may be required to generate a more complete output for your given limit."

      "The olive, a seemingly humble fruit, holds a profound and multifaceted importance in modern society that extends far beyond its culinary applications.  From its historical roots in ancient civilizations to its current role in global economics and health, the olive's influence is widespread and enduring.  Understanding its significance requires examining its contribution to gastronomy, its economic impact, its role in environmental sustainability, and its increasingly recognized health benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "The culinary contribution of olives is undeniable.  For millennia, olives and olive oil have formed the cornerstone of Mediterranean diets, a dietary pattern increasingly recognized for its positive impact on health and longevity.  The fruit itself, whether green, black, or mixed-ripe, boasts a unique and versatile flavor profile, lending itself to diverse culinary preparations.  From simple appetizers like marinated olives to complex dishes featuring olive tapenade or stuffed olives, its versatility is unmatched.  Beyond the olive fruit itself, olive oil reigns supreme as a cooking\n"

He looked around, taking in his surroundings. He was in a lush, hidden garden, filled with fragrant roses, towering sunflowers, and a babbling brook. A tiny, curious squirrel peeked at him from behind a tree trunk.\n",

      "\n",
      "As the sun began to set, Barnaby felt a tug at his heart. He missed the warmth of his home, the comforting scent of his human, and the familiar routine. With a sigh, he looked at the magical red ball, now resting peacefully on the grass. He batted it lightly, and a familiar swirl of colors engulfed him.\n",

      "Bartholomew wasn't your typical dragon. He wasn't interested in fiery breaths or scorching villages. He yearned for stories, not destruction. His scales, a patchwork of dusty rose and faded green, reflected the quiet life he led in his mountain cave, filled with old books and the comforting hum of his wind-up gramophone. \n",
      "\n",
      "One rainy afternoon, while lost in the pages of a dusty tome about faraway lands, Bartholomew stumbled upon a legend - a tale of the Emerald Waterfall, said to possess a mystical power to grant wishes. This spark ignited a fire in his soul, a longing for something more than the routine of reading and snoring. \n",
      "\n",
      "His decision was made. Bartholomew would journey to the Emerald Waterfall. \n",
      "\n",
      "He packed a satchel with a jar of honey (he'd heard the Waterfall had friendly pixies), his well-worn gramophone, and a collection of his favorite books. Leaving the cave, he unfurled his magnificent wings, scales gleaming under the sun, and took off. The wind roared in his ears, and he felt a thrill of joy he'd never known. \n",
      "\n",
      "The journey was fraught with challenges: treacherous mountain passes, grumpy griffins who didn't appreciate his impromptu serenades, and a persistent squirrel who stole his lunch (he still hadn't recovered his beloved sunflower seed cake). \n",
      "\n",
      "But Bartholomew pressed on, fuelled by the stories he'd read and the growing anticipation of reaching the Waterfall. Finally, after weeks of flying, he saw it: a cascading green torrent shimmering under a rainbow. It was magnificent. \n",
      "\n",
      "As Bartholomew landed by the Waterfall, he saw a shimmering form. It was a pixie, with emerald wings and eyes as bright as the Waterfall itself. She welcomed him with a smile.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have heard tales of a dragon seeking a wish,\" she said. \"What is it you desire?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bartholomew, ever the storyteller, launched into a speech, his voice booming like thunder, about the books he'd read and the tales he longed to tell.  His wish, he revealed, wasn't for riches or power, but for the ability to weave his own tales, to share the magic he found in the written word with the world. \n",
      "\n",
      "The pixie laughed, a sound like tinkling bells. \"A noble wish, dear dragon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With a shimmer of green light, Bartholomew felt a change within him. He wasn't sure what it was at first, but when he returned to his cave, he realized what the pixie had given him - the gift of storytelling. \n",
      "\n",
      "Bartholomew, the once-silent dragon, was now a weaver of words, a bard of tales. He started small, reading his stories to the griffins he had met on his journey.  Slowly, word spread about the dragon who told stories as enchanting as his fiery breath, and soon, he found himself entertaining a crowd of creatures from all walks of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "He never forgot the lessons learned on his journey to the Emerald Waterfall. He had learned that the greatest treasures are found not in power or wealth, but in the stories we tell and the connections we forge. And though his fiery breath remained unused, Bartholomew‚Äôs tales burned brighter than any flame, touching the hearts and imaginations of all who listened. \n",
