    "\n",
    "Learn to build sophisticated AI agents by understanding their core components and the iterative development process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code labs cover how to connect LLMs to existing systems and to the real world. Learn about function calling by giving SQL tools to a chatbot, and learn how to build a LangGraph agent that takes orders in a café.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will use the Gemini API's automatic function calling to build a chat interface over a local database. This example is a toy and is missing a number of safety and security constraints you would use in a real-world example.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will use [LangGraph](https://www.langchain.com/langgraph) to define a stateful graph-based application built on top of the Gemini API.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will build a simulated cafe ordering system, called BaristaBot. It will provide a looping chat interface to customers where they can order cafe beverages using natural language, and you will build nodes to represent the cafe's live menu and the \"back room\" ordering system.\n",
    "\n",
    "BaristaBot is used in other Gemini API demos, so if you are looking to explore something with a more minimal implementation, check out the [BaristaBot function calling example](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/examples/Agents_Function_Calling_Barista_Bot.ipynb) that implements a similar system using only the Gemini API Python SDK and function calling.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **IMPORTANT!**\n",
    "\n",
    "The app built in this notebook takes **user input** using a **text box** ([Python's `input`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input)). These are commented-out to ensure that you can use the `Run all` feature without interruption. Keep an eye out for the steps where you need to uncomment the `.invoke(...)` calls in order to interact with the app.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you wish to save a version of this notebook with `Save and Run all`, you will need to **re-comment** the lines you commented-out to ensure that the notebook can run without human input.\n",

    "## Key concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph applications are built around a **graph** structure. As the developer, you define an application graph that models the state transitions for your application. Your app will define a **state** schema, and an instance of that schema is propagated through the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each **node** in the graph represents an action or step that can be taken. Nodes will make changes to the state in some way through code that you define. These changes can be the result of invoking an LLM, by calling an API, or executing any logic that the node defines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each **edge** in the graph represents a transition between states, defining the flow of the program. Edge transitions can be fixed, for example if you define a text-only chatbot where output is always displayed to a user, you may always transition from `chatbot -> user`. The transitions can also be conditional, allowing you to add branching (like an `if-else` statement) or looping (like `for` or `while` loops).\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph is highly extensible and provides a number of features that are not part of this tutorial, such as memory, persistance and streaming. To better understand the key concepts and philophies behind LangGraph, check out their [Conceptual guides](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/) and [High-level overview](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/high_level/)."

    "## Define core instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "State is a fundamental concept for a LangGraph app. A state object is passed between every node and transition in the app. Here you define a state object, `OrderState`, that holds the conversation history, a structured order, and a flag indicating if the customer has finished placing their order. For simplicity, the \"structure\" in this order is just a list of strings, but this can be expanded to any Python data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the LangGraph state object is a Python [dictionary](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict). You can provide a schema for this dictionary by defining it as a [`TypedDict`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.TypedDict).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here you also define the system instruction that the Gemini model will use. You can capture tone and style here, as well as the playbook under which the chatbot should operate."
