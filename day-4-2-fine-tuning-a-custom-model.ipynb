    "# Day 4 - Fine tuning a custom model\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome back to the [Kaggle and Google 5-day Generative AI course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn-guide/5-day-genai)!\n",
    "\n",
    "🎒 **Today’s Assignment**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Complete Unit 4: “Domain-Specific LLMs”, which is:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - *Optional* - Listen to the summary [podcast episode](https://youtu.be/b1a4ZOQ8XdI) for this unit (created by [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com/)).\n",
    "   - Read the [“Solving Domain-Specific Problems Using LLMs” whitepaper\"](https://www.kaggle.com/whitepaper-solving-domains-specific-problems-using-llms).\n",
    "   - Complete these code labs on Kaggle:\n",
    "      1. [Use](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-4-google-search-grounding) Google Search data in generation\n",
    "      2. [Tune](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-4-fine-tuning-a-custom-model) a Gemini model for a custom task - (**This notebook**)\n",
    "2. Watch the [YouTube livestream recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odvuLMJWUSU&list=PLqFaTIg4myu-b1PlxitQdY0UYIbys-2es&index=4). Paige Bailey will be joined by expert speakers from Google - Scott Coull, Antonio Gulli, Anant Nawalgaria, Christopher Semturs, and Umesh Shankar. to discuss domain specific models.\n",
    "\n",
    "💡 **What You’ll Learn**\n",
    "\n",
    "In today’s reading, you’ll delve into the creation and application of specialized LLMs like SecLM and MedLM/Med-PaLM, with insights from the researchers who built them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will use [Google Search](https://google.com/) results with the Gemini API in a technique called grounding, where the model is connected to verifiable sources of information. Using search grounding is similar to using the RAG system you implemented earlier in the week, but the Gemini API automates a lot of it for you. The model generates Google Search queries and invokes the searches automatically, retrieving relevant data from Google's index of the web and providing links to search suggestions that support the query, so your users can verify the sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook you will use the Gemini API to fine-tune a custom, task-specific model. Fine-tuning can be used for a variety of tasks from classic NLP problems like entity extraction or summarisation, to creative tasks like stylised generation. You will fine-tune a model to classify the category a piece of text (a newsgroup post) into the category it belongs to (the newsgroup name).\n",
    "\n",
    "This codelab walks you tuning a model with the API. [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/tune) also supports creating new tuned models directly in the web UI, allowing you to quickly create and monitor models using data from Google Sheets, Drive or your own files."
