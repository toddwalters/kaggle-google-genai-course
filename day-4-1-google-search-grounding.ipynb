    "# Day 4 - Google Search grounding with the Gemini API\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome back to the [Kaggle and Google 5-day Generative AI course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn-guide/5-day-genai)!\n",
    "\n",
    "🎒 **Today’s Assignment**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Complete Unit 4: “Domain-Specific LLMs”, which is:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - *Optional* - Listen to the summary [podcast episode](https://youtu.be/b1a4ZOQ8XdI) for this unit (created by [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com/)).\n",
    "   - Read the [“Solving Domain-Specific Problems Using LLMs” whitepaper\"](https://www.kaggle.com/whitepaper-solving-domains-specific-problems-using-llms).\n",
    "   - Complete these code labs on Kaggle:\n",
    "      1. [Use](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-4-google-search-grounding) Google Search data in generation - (**This notebook**)\n",
    "      2. [Tune](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-4-fine-tuning-a-custom-model) a Gemini model for a custom task\n",
    "2. Watch the [YouTube livestream recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odvuLMJWUSU&list=PLqFaTIg4myu-b1PlxitQdY0UYIbys-2es&index=4). Paige Bailey will be joined by expert speakers from Google - Scott Coull, Antonio Gulli, Anant Nawalgaria, Christopher Semturs, and Umesh Shankar. to discuss domain specific models.\n",
    "\n",
    "💡 **What You’ll Learn**\n",
    "\n",
    "In today’s reading, you’ll delve into the creation and application of specialized LLMs like SecLM and MedLM/Med-PaLM, with insights from the researchers who built them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will use [Google Search](https://google.com/) results with the Gemini API in a technique called grounding, where the model is connected to verifiable sources of information. Using search grounding is similar to using the RAG system you implemented earlier in the week, but the Gemini API automates a lot of it for you. The model generates Google Search queries and invokes the searches automatically, retrieving relevant data from Google's index of the web and providing links to search suggestions that support the query, so your users can verify the sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Enable billing or use AI Studio\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important!**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to complete this codelab. Either through Google AI Studio, or through the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grounding with Google Search is only available through the API for **\"pay-as-you-go\"** accounts. However, you can try the feature for **no charge** in [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/). **You are not required to enable billing to complete this course.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Continue on with this guide from the `API: Get set up` section if you have enabled billing for your API key, or continue to `No charge: Use Google AI Studio` to try out the feature free of charge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that Grounding with Google Search has been released as a limited launch and is not available in all locations. The EEA, UK, and CH regions will be supported at a later date. Running this notebook is **optional** and not required for the 5-day GenAI course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Check out the following links related to billing:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Learn how to [enable billing](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/billing#enable-cloud-billing)\n",
    "* Learn about Google Cloud's [$300 credit for new customers](https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/free-cloud-features) and [other no-cost options](https://cloud.google.com/free)\n",
